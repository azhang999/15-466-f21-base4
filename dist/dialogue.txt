It’s your first semester at CMU, you’re nervous about how it will go. 
Will you be stuck in your room every day doing homework?
Will you party too hard and fail all your classes?
The possibilities are endless-- choose wisely young freshman.

Looks like you didn’t pay attention to your academics enough.
You had a lot of fun this semester but you ended up failing 15-112.
Make sure you study more next semester.

Looks like you didn’t pay enough attention to your social life.
You passed your classes but you have no friends.
Better try to meet some people next semester.

Looks like you didn’t pay enough attention to your health.
You passed your classes and had fun, but you feel miserable.
Maybe take a nap once in a while next semester.

You got an A in 15-112, made a lot of friends and got a reasonable amount of sleep.
Congrats on making it through your first semester successfully!
Get ready for 7 more long semesters…
